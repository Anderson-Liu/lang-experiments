The first line:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

is an **include statement** that tells the compiler to put code from the header
file called iostream into our program before creating the executable.

The iostream header file comes with your compiler and allows you to perform input
and output.

Using #include effectively takes everything in the header file and pastes it into
your program. By including header files, you gain access to the many functions provided
by your compiler.

Whenever we need access to basic functions, we'll need to include the header file that
gives access to that function
